Correcting Right Eye model, so probably avoid it

This model is loosely based on Denoising AutoEncoders. While in Denoising AutoEncoders, the Encoder compresses higher dimensional data 
to lower dimensional dataspace hoping that the lossy compression leads to a drop in the noise of the image and Decoder reconstructs a 
noiseless higher dimensional object from the lower dimensional data. In our model, the Encoder compresses higher dimensional data to lower 
dimensional dataspace retaining essential features, the decoder model not only reconstructs a higher dimensional image but, also corrects 
the gaze direction simultaneously.
